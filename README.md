Word Guess Game AKA Hangman#  

This project is a rendition of hangman with a medieval theme.

Users start the game by pressing any letter key; note this will be the first guess.

Each subsequent key stroke, of a letter key, will be logged as either a correct guess or incorrect gues.

Correct guesses will be input into the guess word. Incorrect guesses will be logged and one will be deducted from your guesses remaining.

If you run out of guesses, you lose and the game will reset.

If you guess the word, you win.

This project provides a great introduction to Javascript and combines this knowledge with both HTML and CSS.
